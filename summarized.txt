I was watching the bridge and the African looking country of the Ebro Delta and wondering how long now it would be before we would see the enemy and listening all the while for the first noises that would signal that ever mysterious event called contact and the old man still sat there.He did not look like a shepherd nor a herdsman and I looked at his black dusty clothes and his gray dusty face and his steel rimmed spectacles and said What animals were they
Various animals he said and shook his head.The mule drawn carts staggered up the steep bank from the bridge with soldiers helping push against the spokes of the wheels.And you have no family I asked watching the far end of the bridge where a few last carts were hurrying down the slope of the bank.That and the fact that cats know how to look after themselves was all the good luck that old man would ever have.
