I was watching the bridge and the African looking country of the Ebro Delta and wondering how long now it would be before we would see the enemy and listening all the while for the first noises that would signal that ever mysterious event called contact and the old man still sat there.He did not look like a shepherd nor a herdsman and I looked at his black dusty clothes and his gray dusty face and his steel rimmed spectacles and said What animals were they
Various animals he said and shook his head.He looked at me very blankly and tiredly and then said having to share his worry with someone The cat will be all right I am sure.But what will they do under the artillery when I was told to leave because of the artillery Did you leave the dove cage unlocked I asked.And you have no family I asked watching the far end of the bridge where a few last carts were hurrying down the slope of the bank.
